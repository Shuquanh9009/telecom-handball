        <h1><strong>How To Play & Strategies</strong></h1>
        <h3>(Singles) Make use of the corners</h3>
        <h3>(Doubles) Serve to the long line as it pushes the players back</h3>
        <h3>Power - The amount of strength used on a server</h3>
        <h3>
          <li>Can either increase the speed and/or distance</li>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>Get more power by stepping into the shot & whipping</li>
        </h3>
        <h3><strong>Angle</strong> - The number of degrees made by the ball from the beginning of the release to where the ball bounces on the ground</h3>
        <h3>
          <li>Make sure the angle would not make the ball go out</li>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>Angle more by going towards one side of the court, however, you will lose control on that side</li>
        </h3>
        <h3><strong>Height</strong> - How high the ball’s starting point is</h3>
        <h3>
          <li>You can hit a low ball of the serve to the long line</li>
        <h3>
          <li>Can refer to changing the height at which you return the ball on the serve</li>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>Can refer to changing the height of the ball’s trajectory.</li>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>When changing the initial height you are able to serve lower with a straight angle if you need a low height</li>
        </h3>
        <h2><strong>Returns:</strong></h2>
        <h3>Your returns are going to be very important during an ace ball game. Depending on how skilled your opponent is, they might be able to control the ball very smoothly. (Lightly returning the ball is not a very smart idea)</h3>
        <h3>(Doubles) Always call the ball if you are going to hit it, especially when it is down the middle</h3>
        <h3>After returning, do not stay in that area and move elsewhere</h3>
        <h3>Attack your opponent’s weaker second serve</h3>
        <h3>Do not return a weak serve with a weak return; Be aggressive</h3>
        <h2><strong>Positioning:</strong></h2>
        <h3>Always be in ready position; Do not just stand there; Do not be stiff; Do not stay in one place/area in the same position</h3>
        <h3>(Doubles) Do not be next to each other and be on your respective sides of the court</h3>
        <h3>When you are going to hit with your right hand, put your left foot forward, do not face the wall, and then hit the ball</h1>
          <h2><strong>Mentality:</strong></h1>
        <h3>Stay focused on what you can control and not on what you cannot control; Do not linger on mistakes</h3>
        <h3>Mental imagery; Predict / Visualize where the ball will go, where the player will go and how they will hit the ball, etc.</h3>
        <h3>Have confidence in your shots or your partner’s shots (doubles)</h3>
        <h3>(Doubles) Trust your partner with getting the ball and make sure to call the shots before it is too late and no one gets it</h3>
        <h3>Stay relaxed under pressure; Think about your own game and do not ask other players for their scores when you are still in the game</h3>
        <h3>Understanding the flow of your game</h3>
        <h3>When you play a game whether it is competitive or casual you usually have a playstyle. Finding your weaknesses, habits and also strengths can all improve your game. Your play style is like a conversation. It can be very different depending on
          who the other person is/ what their personality is like.</h3>
        <h2><strong>Time Outs (TO):</strong></h3>
        <h3>Time outs are 1 min long and only 3 TOs are allowed per side</h3>
        <h3>Can only call before the ref announces the score or cause the second serve after a fault.</h1>
        <h3><strong>Reasons to call a TO:</strong></h3>
        <h3>If your score difference gap is too large, you can stop the momentum of the opponent(s) and get yourself more focused</h3>
        <h3>Water Break + Cool Down</h3>
        <h3>Coach’s Recommendations, talk with your coach if you are struggling with any part of the game</h3>
        <h3>Injured during a match (not before) - 15 min max TO; If you are not able to play after that, the match will be awarded to the opponent(s)</h3>
        <h2><strong>Winner Shots:</strong></h2>
        <h2><strong>List of Winning Shots:</strong></h2>
        <h3>
          <li>Hitting a killer so that your opponent can’t reach the ball</li>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>Dropping the ball by using a topspin on the ball</li>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>Hitting a passing shot where your opponent is close to the wall and you hit the ball deep to the backcourt (or you see your opponent moving closer to the wall expecting a kill)</li>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <li>Aiming at your opponent by hitting the ball straight back towards the chest of your opponent (This is very useful if your opponent isn’t very agile, is extremely close to the wall)</li>
        </h3>
        <h2><strong>Rallies:</strong></h2>
        <h3>Play with control and accuracy</h1>
        <h3>Try to do unexpected shots to throw the opponent off</h1>
        <h3>Break the pattern/rhythm/ pace and make your opponent run</h1>
        <h3>Aim towards their less dominant side, their chest, or their feet</h1>
        <h3>Do not “set the ball” / hit an easy shot for the opponent</h1>
        <h2><strong>Calls:</strong></h2>
        <h3>You don’t have to say each call by their respective name. You can just say <strong>“hold it”</strong> (pause the play)</h1>
        <h3>When you are trying to pull your arm back for a swing and your opponent is interfering with your shot you can call backswing. It is not backswing if you are running to hit the ball with your arm out. You must be in
          a position to swing.</h3>
        <h3>Screening is when your opponent is obstructing your view of the ball with their body. It is not screen if they hit the ball in front of them and you cannot see the ball if you are behind them. When you serve and the ball
          goes between your legs it is an automatic screen. Screens are equal to ½ a short so 2 screens is equal to 1 fault, 4 screens are equal to down. If you are not the server and you screen the ball, you are not penalized.</h3>
        <h3><strong>Moving:</strong> You can call moving when your opponent is interfering with your shot with their body whether if it’s because they are in the way of the ball or they are moving in front of you trying to get an advantageous position</h3>
        <h3><strong>Ball On Court:</strong> Usually the ref will call “ball on” court if it is obstructing the play however players may also call it. Sometimes the call may be overruled because it has nothing to do with the play.</h3>
        <h3><strong>Foot Fault / Line Violation:</strong> Some refs (especially in important games such as the finals or in important tournaments) will call “foot fault” which is stepping on the line or crossing the short line on serve before releasing the
          ball from your hand. Foot fault is equal to ½ short.</h3>
        <h2><strong> To hit a ball:</strong></h2>
        <h3>When you hit a ball you have to keep your hand in a solid hold. You have to feel like you’re patting someone on the head but make sure you don’t break position. Usually, people will “cuff” their hands bit more than just leaving it in that position,
          however, the hand must be bent/curved like a “C” shape.</h3>
        <h3>Whipping is the technique where you roll the ball in your hand so that it doesn’t hurt your hand and also puts a spin to the ball.</h3>
        <h3>Rolling the ball in your hand might seem like it’s cheating since you aren’t “hitting” the ball but whipping is just using the force of the ball to go back. It’s like a marble in a semicircular pipe however the pipe is your hand and the marble
          is the handball. The force of the ball makes the ball go through the pipe and exit at the other end. As the ball coming towards you-you have to position yourself so that you can go against the force of the ball to hit it back against the wall.
          After you get your form down you can start adjusting how you swing and how much you swing your arm to change where the ball will release from your hand.</h3>
        <h3><strong>Trick shots:</strong> cuts/slices, wall-left-right corners, aiming for the short line</h3>
