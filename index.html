			<h1><strong>How To Play:</strong></h4>
			<h1><strong>Singles</strong></h1>
				<h1>Make use of the corners</h1>
			<h1><strong>Doubles</strong></h1>
			<h1>Serve to the long line as it pushes the players back</h1>
			<h1>Power - The amount of strength used on a server</h1>
			<h1><li>Can either increase the speed and/or distance</li></h1>
			<h1><li>Get more power by stepping into the shot & whipping</li></h1>
			<h1><strong>Angle</strong> - The number of degrees made by the ball from the beginning of the release to where the ball bounces on the ground</h1>
			<h1><li>Make sure the angle would not make the ball go out</li></h1>
			<h1><li>Angle more by going towards one side of the court, however, you will lose control on that side</li></h1>
			<h1>Height - How high the ball’s starting point is</h1>
			<h1><li>You can hit a low ball of the serve to the long line</h1>
			<h1><li>Can refer to changing the height at which you return the ball on the serve</li></h1>
			<h1><li>Can refer to changing the height of the ball’s trajectory.</li></h1>
			<h1><li>When changing the initial height you are able to serve lower with a straight angle if you need a low height</li></h1>
			<h1>Different Serves (1 being the lowest & 3 being the highest)</h1>
			<h1>Returns</h1>
			<h1>Your returns are going to be very important during an ace ball game. Depending on how skilled your opponent is, they might be able to control the ball very smoothly. (Lightly returning the ball is not a very smart idea)</h1>
			<h1>Be in the ready position</h1>
			<h1>(Doubles) Always call the ball if you are going to hit it, especially when it is down the middle</h1>
			<h1>After returning, do not stay in that area and move elsewhere</h1>
			<h1>Attack your opponent’s weaker second serve</h1>
			<h1>Do not return a weak serve with a weak return; Be aggressive</h1>
			<h1></h1>
			<h1><strong>Positioning</strong></h1>
			<h1>Always be in ready position; Do not just stand there; Do not be stiff; Do not stay in one place/area in the same position</h1>
			<h1>(Doubles) Do not be next to each other and be on your respective sides of the court</h1>
			<h1>When you are going to hit with your right hand, put your left foot forward, do not face the wall, and then hit the ball</h1>
			<h1></h1>
			<h1>Singles: A great way to gain the advantage in singles is through your positioning. When you position yourself for different shots. Faking out your opponent with a different angle your body is facing. Waiting to see if your opponent is going in a certain
				direction and hit the ball to the other side. Positioning is putting yourself in an ideal spot on the courts as well as setting yourself up for a comfortable shot. You can also try to mess up your opponent by hitting different shots making it harder
				for your opponent to correctly judge your shot. Move your opponent! Don’t hit the ball to your opponent as a set-up. Some power shots can jam your opponent however there conditions that have to be met in order to jam them. (you need the power for
				the ball to travel fast, as well as the opponent must be moving in a certain direction so that when the ball reaches them it is directly at their upper body.</h1>
			<h1></h1>
			<h1></h1>
			<h1>Mentality</h1>
			<h1>Stay focused on what you can control and not on what you cannot control; Do not linger on mistakes</h1>
			<h1>Mental imagery; Predict / Visualize where the ball will go, where the player will go and how they will hit the ball, etc.</h1>
			<h1>Have confidence in your shots or your partner’s shots (doubles)</h1>
			<h1>(Doubles) Trust your partner with getting the ball and make sure to call the shots before it is too late and no one gets it</h1>
			<h1>Stay relaxed under pressure; Think about your own game and do not ask other players for their scores when you are still in the game</h1>
			<h1>Ignore the cheering of the crowd from the opposing team</h1>
			<h1>Understanding the flow of your game</h1>
			<h1>When you play a game whether it is competitive or casual you usually have a playstyle. Finding your weaknesses, habits and also strengths can all improve your game. Your play style is like a conversation. It can be very different depending on who the
				other person is/ what their personality is like.</h1>
			<h1>Time Outs (TO)</h1>
			<h1>Time outs are 1 min long and only 3 TOs are allowed per side</h1>
			<h1>Can only call before the ref announces the score or cause the second serve after a fault.</h1>
			<h1>Reasons to call a TO:</h1>
			<h1>If your score difference gap is too large, you can stop the momentum of the opponent(s) and get yourself more focused</h1>
			<h1>Water Break + Cool Down</h1>
			<h1>Coach’s Recommendation - Talk with your coach if you are struggling with any part of the game</h1>
			<h1>Injured during a match (not before) - 15 min max TO; If you are not able to play after that, the match will be awarded to the opponent(s)</h1>
			<h1></h1>
			<h1>Winners</h1>
			<h1>Rallying for a long time can be very stressing and straining. It is better if you don’t waste your energy and go for “winners”. Hitting winners means you will most likely win the rally with 1 shot. That 1 shot may be a difficult shot or it might just
				be a shot that your opponent wasn’t expecting. That doesn’t mean you should kill every ball since it is very difficult and it might not be the right shot at the particular moment (whether you are going to use energy setting up for a kill, or your
				opponent is expecting a kill).</h1>
			<h1>List of Winning Shots During a Rally:</h1>
			<h1>Hitting a killer so that your opponent can’t reach the ball</h1>
			<h1>Dropping the ball by using a topspin on the ball</h1>
			<h1>Hitting a passing shot where your opponent is close to the wall and you hit the ball deep to the backcourt (or you see your opponent moving closer to the wall expecting a kill)</h1>
			<h1>Aiming at your opponent by hitting the ball straight back towards the chest of your opponent (This is very useful if your opponent isn’t very agile, is extremely close to the wall)</h1>
			<h1>Winners are not something that is mostly from luck. Practicing kill shots can confuse your opponent.</h1>
			<h1></h1>
			<h1></h1>
			<h1>Rallies</h1>
			<h1>Play with control and accuracy</h1>
			<h1>Try to do unexpected shots to throw the opponent off</h1>
			<h1>Break the pattern/rhythm/ pace and make your opponent run</h1>
			<h1>Aim towards their less dominant side, their chest, or their feet</h1>
			<h1>Do not “set the ball” / hit an easy shot for the opponent</h1>
			<h1></h1>
			<h1></h1>
			<h1></h1>
			<h1>Calls-</h1>
			<h1>*** You don’t have to say each call by their respective name. You can just say “hold it” (pause the play) ***</h1>
			<h1>Backswing: When you are trying to pull your arm back for a swing and your opponent is interfering with your shot you can call backswing. It is not backswing if you are running to hit the ball with your arm out. You must be in a position to swing.</h1>
			<h1>Screen: Screening is when your opponent is obstructing your view of the ball with their body. It is not screen if they hit the ball in front of them and you cannot see the ball if you are behind them. When you serve and the ball goes between your legs
				it is an automatic screen. Screens are equal to ½ a short so 2 screens is equal to 1 fault, 4 screens are equal to down. If you are not the server and you screen the ball, you are not penalized.</h1>
			<h1>Moving: You can call moving when your opponent is interfering with your shot with their body whether if it’s because they are in the way of the ball or they are moving in front of you trying to get an advantageous position</h1>
			<h1>Ball On Court: Usually the ref will call “ball on” court if it is obstructing the play however players may also call it. Sometimes the call may be overruled because it has nothing to do with the play.</h1>
			<h1>Foot Fault / Line Violation: Some refs (especially in important games such as the finals or in important tournaments) will call “foot fault” which is stepping on the line or crossing the short line on serve before releasing the ball from your hand.
				A(1) foot fault is equal to ½ short.</h1>
			<h1>How to hit a ball-</h1>
			<h1>When you hit a ball you have to keep your hand in a solid hold. You have to feel like you’re patting someone on the head but make sure you don’t break position. Usually, people will “cuff” their hands bit more than just leaving it in that position,
				however, the hand must be bent/curved like a “C” shape.</h1>
			<h1></h1>
			<h1>Whipping: is the technique where you roll the ball in your hand so that it doesn’t hurt your hand and also puts a spin to the ball.</h1>
			<h1></h1>
			<h1>Rolling the ball in your hand might seem like it’s cheating since you aren’t “hitting” the ball but whipping is just using the force of the ball to go back. It’s like a marble in a semicircular pipe however the pipe is your hand and the marble is the
				handball. The force of the ball makes the ball go through the pipe and exit at the other end. As the ball coming towards you-you have to position yourself so that you can go against the force of the ball to hit it back against the wall. After you
				get your form down you can start adjusting how you swing and how much you swing your arm to change where the ball will release from your hand.</h1>
			<h1></h1>
			<h1></h1>
			<h1>Other</h1>
			<h1>Trick shots: cuts/slices, wall-left-right corners, aiming for the short line</h1>
			<h1>Look for patterns AND weaknesses in: serves, returns, positioning, reaction time, technique, movement, weight transfer, shots, etc.</h1>
			<h1>Do not give the opponent points from your mistakes, force them to lose their points on their own</h1>
			<h1>Do not stick to one style of play; Have a variety of shots so that you are not predictable</h1>
			<h1>Study physics</h1>
			<h1>Hit between a roller and a choke</h1>
			<h1>(Doubles) Do not stay too close to the other players as they may block your view/shots and you may not have enough time/room to react</h1>
			<h1>Keep your body in balance; Shift your weight accordingly</h1>
			<h1>Dive for the ball?</h1>
